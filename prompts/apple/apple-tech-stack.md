# Apple Tech Stack

Set up the iOS / macOS toolchain and project with:

- XcodeGen for project generation
- SwiftLint for linting
- SwiftFormat for formatting
- just for task orchestration
- xcbeautify for build logs
- SwiftPM for shared modules consumed outside an Xcode entrypoint (if any)

Use the latest stable Apple SDK and toolchain (Xcode, Swift, platform SDKs): do not assume versions—verify via web search, then pin and document them in the repo.
