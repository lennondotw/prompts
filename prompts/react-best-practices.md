# React Best Practices

## Components

- Use `FC` type annotation for all React components.
- Prefer composition over configuration — pass JSX as children or render props instead of adding more props to a component.
- Keep components small and single-responsibility; extract early when a component handles more than one concern.
- Co-locate related code (component, hook, types, styles) in the same directory.
- Prefer named exports over default exports for better refactoring support and explicit imports, unless the framework requires default exports (e.g., route pages, layouts).

## State

- Minimize state — if it can be computed from existing state or props, derive it during render (or `useMemo`), not in `useEffect`.
- Do not sync state in `useEffect`; use a single source of truth (e.g., reducer, URL params, or lifting state up).
- Use `useReducer` over multiple `useState` when state transitions are interdependent.
- Keep state as close to where it's used as possible; lift only when genuinely shared.

## Effects

- Do not turn user actions into effects; handle them in event handlers.
- `useEffect` is for synchronizing with external systems (DOM APIs, subscriptions, timers) — not for reacting to state changes.
- Every effect must have a proper cleanup function when it holds resources (listeners, timers, abort controllers).

## Performance

- Do not optimize prematurely — profile first, then act.
- Use `React.memo` only on components that re-render frequently with the same props and are expensive to render.
- Stabilize callback and object references with `useCallback` / `useMemo` only when they are passed to memoized children or used in dependency arrays.
- Prefer moving state down or splitting components over adding memoization.
- For lists, use stable, unique `key` values — never use array index as key on reorderable or filterable lists.

## Refs

- Use `ref` for imperative access to DOM nodes or to persist mutable values across renders without triggering re-renders.
- Do not use `ref` as a workaround to avoid dependency arrays in effects.

## Error Handling

- Wrap route-level or feature-level boundaries with Error Boundaries to isolate failures.
- Provide meaningful fallback UI — never leave the user with a blank screen.

## Testing & Stories

- Design every component to be testable in isolation — accept dependencies via props, avoid hard-coded singletons.
- Write unit tests with **React Testing Library**; test behavior and user interactions, not implementation details.
- Provide **Storybook** stories for each component covering all meaningful variants: default, loading, empty, error, edge cases, and responsive breakpoints.

## Custom Hooks

- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks; name them `use*`.
- A custom hook should do one thing; compose multiple hooks rather than building a monolithic one.
- Return the minimal surface area needed by consumers.
