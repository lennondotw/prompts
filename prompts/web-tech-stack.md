# Web Tech Stack

Set up the Web toolchain and project with:

* pnpm for dependency management
* Bun for runtime and scripting
* Vite for dev/build
* React for UI
* TypeScript for typechecking
* Tailwind CSS for styling
* Vitest for unit tests
* Playwright for E2E
* oxlint for linting
* dprint for formatting

Use the latest stable Web toolchain via `pnpm install @latest`. Do not “assume latest” by manually editing versions in `package.json`.
